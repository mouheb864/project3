             <h1>MY VISION OF LIFE</h1>
             <p>Becoming a great man with great ideals has always been an important factor in my life. That’s why I’m trying all my best to reach my goals and to focus on my missions.
                 <br>
                  In spite of my young age, I think I’m wise enough to realize that the purpose of life isn’t really about happiness. I strongly believe that it’s all about the process mainly the pain that we need to overcome and those hard moments that we fall in love with.
                  <br>
                   Personally, I have chosen the side of working and to go hard, not allowing anything to stop or to dater me of my goal. It’s a fine line between dream and truth and my dream is not that difficult: improving humanity, adding my own print to the world and having the ability to make decisions. 
                   <br>
                    all, my personal goals are to learn as much as I can and make my family and myself proud of what I’ve accomplished. Therefore, being surrounded by real friends is so important and for me loyalty is the only thing that matters when it comes to friendship. 
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Savage">21</a> said:”I’d rather have loyalty than love». Love also isn’t easy to explain but I can assume that self love is a must for a healthy life. We need to ask the question” what love got to do with when we don't love ourselves?”
                    <br>
                     self confidence is an attractive quality I have. Everything I have achieved is due to my willingness to press forward. 
                To sum up, life is a very long road that needs a brave personality and some passion to know how to 
                Act when the road becomes a narrow road.

         <section id="THE FUTURE">
             <h1>THE FUTURE</h1>
             <p class="u">To be honest, I didn’t decide yet the main field of major that I wish study. The only thing I
                know is that I will try to become an engineer in either<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics"><button type="button">Astrophysics</button></a>,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power">energy</a> or one
                subject that I probably choose later.
                United states has been an inspiration for me since I’m still a kid. The hip-hop culture and
                American lifestyle that I appreciate created on me the desire of studying there. In addition,
                USA has many opportunities and good jobs to apply for. No doubt, The educational system
                there and good formations in the US colleges are the real purpose of my choice. It’s a whole
                experience that will certainly change my life.
                In the confinement due to Covid virus, I had improved some skills on beat making. While
                listening to music I have the custom to concentrate on the drums and melodies and I was
                always asking myself why I don’t try to produce my own music. Lately, I discovered that it’s
                not curiosity that pushed me to do this but also love and inspirations. In few months, I became
                
                able to make good and catchy beats and I am thinking of a collab with some artists. I love the
                fact that I structure many components and the fact I never felt bored while producing mixing
                and mastering.</p>
